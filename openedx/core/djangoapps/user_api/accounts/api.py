    Note:
        If `requesting_user.username` != `username`, this method will return differing amounts of information

    Args:
        requesting_user (User): The user requesting the account information. Only the user with username
            `username` or users with "is_staff" privileges can get full account information.
            Other users will get the account fields that the user has elected to share.
        username (str): Optional username for the desired account information. If not specified,
            `requesting_user.username` is assumed.
        configuration (dict): an optional configuration specifying which fields in the account
            can be shared, and the default visibility settings. If not present, the setting value with
            key ACCOUNT_VISIBILITY_CONFIGURATION is used.
        view (str): An optional string allowing "is_staff" users and users requesting their own
            account information to get just the fields that are shared with everyone. If view is
            "shared", only shared account information will be returned, regardless of `requesting_user`.

    Returns:
